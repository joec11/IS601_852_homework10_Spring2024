## Reflection Summary
My reflection on this assignment was that I found it to be very rewarding in learning about how to perform the role as a Software QA Analyst. I gained important technical skills and problem solving skills that would benefit me in my career. Technical skills included using Git for version control and GitHub to make use of GitHub Actions. In addition to using Git, I became more familiar with using the commands such as merging branches, and pulling and pushing changes between the remote repository and my local repository. Problem solving skills included diagnosing and fixing issues, and understanding the importance of paying attention to detail when testing and debugging an application.

The challenges that I faced were opportunities that helped me grow in my field and gave me the experience and knowledge to perform more effectively when solving software problems in order to find solutions. The solutions that I implemented to the issues that I had discovered in this assignment was refactoring source code and created tests using pytest with coverage. This assignment had taught me the importance of following software standards when developing and testing software.
